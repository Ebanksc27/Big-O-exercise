  // but since the 'vowels' string is of constant length, it simplifies to O(1). Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).


  // Focus on how the number of operations grows with the size of the input (n or array length). 
  // The key is identifying loops (single or nested) and understanding how many times they iterate relative to the input size.
